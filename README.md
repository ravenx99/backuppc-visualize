backuppc-visualize
==================

**BackupPC-Visualize** - a backup duration visualization tool


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Plots a visual timeline of recent BackupPC host backup durations,
allowing a better understanding of which backups are running long or
otherwise causing trouble.

  + Full and incremental backups are shown in different colors.
  + An exclude list filters hosts from the output.
  + Number of days to plot is adjustable.
  + Sort by host name or start of most recent backup.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

Requires the Ploticus graphical plotting package.
See <http://ploticus.sourceforge.net/>


USAGE
-----

BackupPC-Visualize (bpcviz) consists of two parts.  A Perl script that
gathers backup data from **/var/lib/backuppc/pc/<host>/backups**, munges
and sorts the data, and a Ploticus script that renders the data in a
useful display.

The intention is to generate graphs that can be viewed online
(launched from a cronjob or a simple web form), but bpcviz works
equally well from the command-line directly on the BackupPC server or
on a copy of the "backups" files on your own workstation.

bpcviz-gatherdata takes the following optional parameters:

  + -d <days> : the number of days to view, always anchored on "today"
  + -p <path> : path to backup data; defaults to
    **/var/lib/backuppc/pc**
  + -e '<exclude list>' : a space-separated list of Perl regular
    expressions to filter from the host names
  + -s <time|host> : Sort by host name or start time of most recent
    backup.  The default is "time".

**bpcviz.plot** is the default Ploticus script.  Feel free to use this
as a starting point to customize your own plot output.
**bpcviz-gatherdata** is called directly from the Ploticus script, so any
adjustment to its parameters is done here.

**doit** is a simple example script that runs the Ploticus script and
displays the graph (using ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick's **display**
command).  If you are on Debian Linux, the Ploticus package doesn't
name the Ploticus binary as "pl" as Ploticus expects.  I create a
symlink of **/usr/local/bin/pl**.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
I Get the Message: **sh: 1: bpcviz-gatherdata: not found** and there is
no data in the generated image.
This is because the Scipt to gather the data (bpcviz-gatherdata) is not found in $PATH
You can either:
	+ edit bpcviz.plot and change **command: bpcviz-gatherdata** to **command: ./bpcviz-gatherdata**
	+ add the directory where bpcviz-gatherdata resides to $PATH: **PATH=$PATH:/directory/where/bpvisualize/is**
	+ link to the bpcviz-gatherdata script: **ln -s /directory/where/bpvisualize/is/bpcviz-gatherdata /usr/bin/bpcviz-gatherdata**
